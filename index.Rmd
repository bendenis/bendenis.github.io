title: 'Applied Statistics: _Analytical and Computational Methods_'

#What You Might Find Here:

This website is built from RMarkdown documents, so for the most part you can expect to see statistical and computational methods implimented and explained using R. STATA and SAS might also be included. I will also do my best to include Linux workflow because I found that effective use of the terminal is very important for productivity, especially when talking about "Big Data". That being said, the website for the most part serves as kind of a notebook. Most of the content will be based on my graduate coursework at the University of Michigan. However, I am not planning to simply upload my homework solutions. The homeworks are restricted in scope, and I want to go deeper into the ideas and some of the theory behind the methods. Additionally I have an interest of dedicating a section of the website to full analysis cases, perhaps from Kaggle or DrivenData.


#About Me:

Currently I am pursuing a M.S. in Applied Statistics at the University of Michigan and expect to graduate either December 2017 or April 2018, depending on what I decide. Previously I have completed my B.A. at Boston University where I double majored in Mathematic and Economics. My career interests are in tech and managment consulting. I am particularly interested in the domains of personal health, online education, but more generally innovation which is most offten driven by tech these days. R programming is perhaps my greatest technical competancy at this point. Slowly getting into web-development. Other then that, I love to travel and try to always stay active doing sports and fitness. 


#Courses:

These are the courses based on which I am building the content of the website. I'll be adding courses as I progress with my studies, and after completeing a course I'll append a description.

- Statistical Learning I: Regression [STATS:500]
- Statistical Learning II: Multivariate Analysis [STATS:503]
- Computational Methods & Tools [STATS:506]
- Spatial Statistics [BIOSTAT:696]
